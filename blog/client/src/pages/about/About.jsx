Throughout my career in music I have served many roles within different ensembles ranging from principal clarinetist, soloist, and concert master. Outside of the performing, I regularly compose music for a variety of ensembles and projects. As a composer I won the MTNA Young Artist Composition Competition in the State of Georgia and my music has contributed to the success of student film shocase winner "Payton's Place". These feats were all accomplished while I was actively teaching music. Most recently I was recognized by my school, Chukker Creek Elementary, as Teacher of the Year, an honor I take great pride in as it was awarded to me exactly a decade after I first began teaching.</p>

In developing new software and customizing websites fuels my need to be creative on a daily basis. Since beginning my journey into software development I have learned and found ways to implement a variety of technologies including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, API Git, Sass React, Node, Express, MongoDB, and SQL. I love the idea that with technology, my potential to impact others is simply greater and I want to use my knowledge to craft intuitive products that aid people with what their needs.</p>
